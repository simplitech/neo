## Test Results

| Test Name | Network | OS | Test Result | Comments |
| ------- |:-------:| --:| -----------:| --------:|
| Initial UT | UT | Localhost | OK | 
| Connect to Testnet | Testnet | Windows 10 x64 | OK | |

## **Test List**

**1. Initial UT**  
Run solution unit tests.

**2. Connect to Testnet**  
Using neo-cli, connect to Neo 3 testnet and sync the whole network.   

Start test:
- Replace the content in `protocol.json` with the content `protocol.testnet.json`;
- Open neo-cli;
- Use `show state` to follow application synchronization state;

Expected results:
- The application should gradually synchronize blocks;
- The application must not freeze;
- The application should be able to synchronize the whole network without intervention and without stopping for longer than 1 minute;

**3. Export blocks**  

Start test:
- Install `ImportBlocks` plugin;
- Synchronized node with at least 1000 blocks;

Expected behavior:  
- After the node has fully synced, use `export blocks` from the `ImportBlocks` plugin to export blockchain data. A new file should be generated in the application folder, with the `.acc` extension.  
- Program must not freeze;
- Generated output file should have at least a few megabytes (for Testnet)

**Import blocks**  

The application should be able to restore network state using the generated file in step 3.

Start test:
- Zip the file generated by the application in test 3;
- Delete any Chain* folder inside the application folder;
- Start neo-cli;

Expected behavior:
- The application should sync blocks from 0 to the package height without having nodes connected;
- After syncing all blocks, it should automatically connect to nodes in the network;
